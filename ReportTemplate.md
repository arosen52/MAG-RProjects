Thank you for completing the Understanding and Monitoring Funding Streams in Ryan White Clinics Survey. Your response to the survey was crucial in providing the HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) and policymakers with a better understanding of how the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) currently provides primary outpatient health care and essential support services to both uninsured and underinsured clients. This document summarizes your survey responses compared to other Part C and D grantee/providers that responded to the survey.
